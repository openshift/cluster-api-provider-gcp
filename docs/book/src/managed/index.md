<h1>Warning</h1>

Provisioning managed clusters (GKE) is an experimental feature and, as such, it may behave unreliably until promoted to the main repository.

## Overview

The GCP provider supports creating GKE based cluster. Currently the following features are supported:

- Provisioning/managing a GCP GKE Cluster
- Upgrading the Kubernetes version of the GKE Cluster
- Creating a managed node pool and attaching it to the GKE cluster

The implementation introduces the following CRD kinds:

- GCPManagedCluster - presents the properties needed to provision and manage the general GCP operating infrastructure for the cluster (i.e project, networking, iam)
- GCPManagedControlPlane - specifies the GKE Cluster in GCP and used by the Cluster API GCP Managed Control plane
- GCPManagedMachinePool - defines the managed node pool for the cluster

And a new template is available in the templates folder for creating a managed workload cluster.
